A simple one player black jack game.
Built with HTML, CSS and Javascript.  

Created to reinforce what i have recently learned in javascript. Arrays, booleans, for loops, math objects and functions.
The goal wasn't to make it look pretty but to make sure it works. 

in time i will expand on this, or completely redo it and have it store data of previous rounds, and maybe even make an AI Dealer to play against.
